<h1>About</h1>

<p>I'm a developer, husband, dog dad, and former aspiring pastor.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm working at <a href="https://soona.co">soona</a> as a full stack engineer, building out a content creation platform primarily with Vue.js and Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about making things and teaching others code. When I'm not coding, you can probably find me spending time with my wife Megan, reading, playing ice hockey, or camping.</p>
